This folder holds common policies to be deployed. Policies always
go onto the hub cluster - and use Placement Rules and Placement Bindings to select which
cluster they apply to.

Each policy should go into its own directory.

Policies should be deployed into the `acm-policies` namespace - unless they distribute
secrets to other clusters, then they go into the `acm-secrets` namespace.

## Policy Generator
Generate Open Cluster Management policies from existing Kubernetes manifests in your repository using the Policy Generator Kustomize plugin through GitOps in Open Cluster Management.
